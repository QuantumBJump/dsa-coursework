\section*{Executive Summary}
This report compares and contrasts the time efficiency of the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Merge Sort algorithms, and contains an appendix with pseudocode for a function to segregate even and odd numbers in an array.

\chapter{Setting up Sort\textunderscore Tester.java}
In order to set up the testing, I first added the following code to allow the user to define the size of the random array to generate.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption=Accepting user input]
import java.util.Scanner;
...
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("How big is your array?");
int arraySize = scanner.nextInt();
\end{lstlisting}

Then I generated a random array of that size using:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption=Generating the randomised array]
import java.util.Random;
...
int[] arr = new int[arraySize];
Random random = new Random();
for (int i = 0; i < arrayLength; i++) {
    arr[i] = random.nextInt(50);
}
\end{lstlisting}

Before running each test, I copied the generated randomised array into a second array, \texttt{toBeSorted}, so I could sort that array without affecting the original array. This meant that each algorithm was operating on the same dataset, which meant the test was fairer.

I then noted the start time, called the algorithm on \texttt{toBeSorted}, noted the finish time and worked out the time elapsed in nanoseconds using \texttt{System.nanoTime()}.
